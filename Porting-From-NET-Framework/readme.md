# Porting From .NET Framework (1 hour)

> In this session, we'll overview how to update existing code from the full .NET Framework to .NET Core. We'll help you understand which code can and can't port eaisly, and we'll go through some real world porting examples.

## Lab: Porting an ASP.NET application to ASP.NET Core 2.0
1. Create a new ASP.NET MVC 5 application in Visual Studio.
1. Following the steps of [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/proper-to-2x/), see if you can port the application to ASP.NET Core 2.0. The tutorial covers the following steps:
   1. Prerequisites
   1. Target Frameworks
   1. Project structure differences
   1. Global.asax file replacement
   1. Storing Configurations
   1. Native Dependency Injection
   1. Serving Static Files
   1. Additional Resources

> *Note*: You might not have time to complete the port in the time allotted. You can come back to it later in the day, or bring it home for homework. The important part is to understand the overall steps involved, not to complete the port.
